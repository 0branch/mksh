This is the README for mirbsdksh, developed as part of the MirBSD
operating system at The MirOS Project, and produced portably.
Legal information is provided about a screenpage farther down.

To build on MirOS only, issue 'make obj && make depend && make'.

To build on other systems, consult http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh
or read Build.sh first.

Set the CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
to your likes. Don't complain if anything doesn't work.

Last updated Jul '99 for pdksh-5.2.14.
	(check ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/ or
	 http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/ for new versions/patches)

PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is mostly finished to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
etc., and is the login shell of ~5200 users.

Note that pdksh is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or
implied.  Also note that although the bulk of the code in pdksh is in the
public domain, some files are copyrighted (but freely distributable) and
subject to certain conditions.

If you would like to be notified via email of new releases as they become
available, send mail to pdksh-request@cs.mun.ca with subject
"send release notifications" (or "don't send release notifications" to stop
them).

Newer versions of pdksh may be available from
	ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/
you may want to check for one if you run into any problems, as the problem may
already be fixed (you can get new release notifications automatically - see
above).  The file pdksh-unstable-XXX.tar.gz has the very latest version which
may not compile (it is generated automatically when changes are detected
in the main source repository) - it is for those who want to follow
changes as they are made.

You can send bug reports, fixes, and enhancements to pdksh@cs.mun.ca (please
don't assume I will see bug reports that are posted to some newsgroup or
mailing list - I probably won't).
If you are reporting a bug (with or without a fix), please include
	* the version of pdksh you are using (see version.c, or, if you are
	  running pdksh, try echo $KSH_VERSION),
	* the machine, operating system and compiler you are using,
	* and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell
	  script that demonstrates the bug is best).
as well as the following, if relevant (if you aren't sure, include them)
	* what options you are using (both configure options and set -o options)
	* the output of configure, with the verbose flag
	  (eg, make distclean; ./configure --verbose)
	* the contents of config.log (this is created by the configure script)
	* if you are using gcc (the GNU C compiler), which version it is.

BTW, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED BUG IS
	echo hi | read a; echo $a	# Does not print hi
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.

Michael Rendell, michael@cs.mun.ca
