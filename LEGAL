pdksh is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or implied.

The vast majority of the code that makes pdksh is in the public domain.
The exceptions are not included in the MirBSD source tree.

That's it.  Short and simple.

Now european (except Commonwealth) copyright laws come into the game.
This means, public domain does not exist, and authors are always
liable for a minimum of things.
That's why, this package is placed under the MirOS licence template, found
at https://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/cvs.cgi/src/share/misc/licence.template
